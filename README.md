# CodeWars_Adder

This is a basic version CodeWars_Adder program.
Right now the main function of the program is to:
* from provided link take the name and rank of the kata,
* With Create File button creates a file ***kata_name.py*** in ***kata rank directory*** with pasted code and link to kata


Right now it's simple just to help me with my [Challenge](https://github.com/sieczkah/Codewars_KATA), 
but soon I would like to add possibility to push the file automatically to github, create a database (will store info which files were saved/pushed on which day, basic stuff) 
to help me track my challenge, and I want the program to handle all possible errors.
