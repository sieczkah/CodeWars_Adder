# CodeWars_Adder

I am doing [5 kata everyday challenge](https://github.com/sieczkah/Codewars_KATA), and I am saving all of my katas on my desktop(later pushing them to git). I found it really annoying to create everythin manually in the good directory, paste code, paste..... trust me it was a nightmare.

So as a little project I created this simple KataAdder/CodewarsAdder with GUI to help me with my challenge. It was a lot of fun.
Firstly it was only adding the Kata (no errors handling, nothing). Then I created messageboxes for info and errors.
Program does:
    <p>
        <img width='400' src="Images\Pandas.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;">
        <li>take link from user input</li>
        <li>Scrapp the page for Kata name and Rank</li>
        <li>Creates and check filename of Kata</li>
        <li>In dir of Kata KYU creates the file - if file exists asking if to overwrite</li>
    </p>
Right now it is super basic, I want to handle more errors, let the user choose the root dir where to create kata directories.
In the future I want it to track the challenge ( done kata, completed days, how much I need to do to keep on track)


Edit: I reorganized the code, and GUI itself, added msgboxes.
